I installed this kit to my bike to commute to work. I enjoy riding to work and planning/reviewing my day while riding.
It is 14 miles ride (800 feet up the hill). It takes 50 minutes to ride or 20 minutes by car. I use a 52V 13 Ah battery and need to recharge the battery after each ride. My Bike's weight 20 kg + my luggage + ~ 80 kg for myself,

**Installation**

There was enough space for the original brake cable and rear derailleur cable.
I had to remove the two screws for the front derailleur cable. However, a front derailleur may not be needed.
In the photo, the plate is still missing. If one wants to route the front derailleur cable in this place, in my case one needs to modify this plate to gain space for the cable as shown below.

A much better solution is shown in the post about the Adventure touring bike!

I ordered a 52 teeth chainring and the kit comes with a 42 teeth chainring. One can mount both well as shown. I only use the 52 teeth chainring even on hills and do not need to use the 42 teeth chainring.

**Handlebar**
I ordered the 860C controller which comes with the selector.  I bought a Bicycle Handlebar Extender online since the selector did not fit onto the handlebar. One gains more space for the light on the Handlebar extender as well.

**Temperature sensor**
I use a 52V battery with 13Ah. I also ordered the temperature sensor and a cooling plate and use the full power of the motor. I am glad that I ordered the temperature sensor since the motor gets hot when riding up a hill. When the motor is getting hot as indicated on the display, the power of the motor is reduced. One does not "drive" but "rides" up the hill.

**Safety**
One needs to be careful riding an electric bike. Please ride carefully!
