NOTE: Before start using the firmware, you must configure correctly the
options on LCD3. For instance, you should configure your battery low
voltage cut off (battery voltage when it is discharged) and all the
other parameters \-- follow the next section.

KT-LCD3 shows and/or configure the following from TSDZ2 motor:

# 1. Main screen {#main_screen}

-   **`<u>`{=html}Main screen`</u>`{=html}**: this is the default screen
    after turn on the LCD.
    -   `<u>`{=html}assist level`</u>`{=html}: Assist level
        scales/amplify the torque sensor signal, if you want a higher
        assist level from the motor, choose the max assist level value.
        Assist level has 5 levels in total and user can define (on
        firmware configuration) a custom scale value for each level.
        Level 0 keep always the motor disabled.
    -   `<u>`{=html}ebike wheel speed`</u>`{=html}: the value can be
        shown in kms or mph.
    -   `<u>`{=html}battery power`</u>`{=html}: real time value in watts
        of the power being draw from the battery.
    -   `<u>`{=html}battery state of charge`</u>`{=html}: 6 different
        levels. When battery is empty, the empty symbol on LCD will also
        blink (state of charge is based on battery voltage and can be
        setup on the motor controller firmware configuration)
    -   `<u>`{=html}lights`</u>`{=html}: enabled with a button up long
        press, the motor controller will enable the ebike lights. LCD
        backlight will also be enabled. (backlight intensity can be
        setup on the motor controller firmware configuration).
    -   `<u>`{=html}brake`</u>`{=html}: LCD symbol is enabled when user
        press the ebike brakes, good to check that sensor brakes are
        working.
    -   `<u>`{=html}walk assist`</u>`{=html}: although it is implemented
        on LCD, it is not yet implemented on the motor controller.
        Enabled with a button down long press.
    -   `<u>`{=html}odometer field`</u>`{=html}: the following
        information will cycle with on/off button click
        -   `<u>`{=html}battery voltage`</u>`{=html}: see your battery
            pack voltage.
        -   `<u>`{=html}battery current`</u>`{=html}: see the current
            being draw from your battery pack.
        -   `<u>`{=html}battery power`</u>`{=html}: see the accumulated
            battery power (in watts/hour) draw from your battery pack,
            since last battery full charge. This value is automatically
            reset when LCD turns on and battery voltage equals to
            charged battery voltage - this value can also be reset or
            set to a custom value on the configurations.
        -   `<u>`{=html}pedal cadence`</u>`{=html}: see the pedals
            cadence in rotations per minute.
    -   `<u>`{=html}battery state of charge in percentage`</u>`{=html}:
        this value can be shown as an option on the temperature field.
        The percentage is based on the accumulated battery power draw
        from your battery pack and user can define on LCD configurations
        menu, the battery pack total watts/hour.

# 2. Max battery power screen {#max_battery_power_screen}

-   **`<u>`{=html}Max battery power screen`</u>`{=html}**: Motor
    controller will automatically choose a battery current in a way to
    limit the max battery power usage. The battery current value will
    never be higher than the max battery current setup on the
    configurations screen. Long click on on/off and up buttons to enter
    on this screen. Up and down buttons to increase/decrease the value.
    Long click of on/off button lo leave.

# 3. Configurations screen {#configurations_screen}

-   **`<u>`{=html}Configurations screen`</u>`{=html}**: long click on up
    and down buttons to enter on this screen. On/off button click to
    enter on subscreens and on/off button click to cycle on subscreens,
    long press on/off to exit menue

THE FOLLOWING CONFIGURATION VALUES ARE FOR VERSION 10!! YOU ALLWAYS NEED
TO FLASH SAME VERSION ON BOTH, MOTOR AND LCD

  1                    Maximum current of battery    16 (amps)           This is the maximum current that will be pulled from your batteries by the TSDZ2 motor controller. This value is limited internally by the firmware to the safe value of 18 amps.
  2                    battery low cut-off voltage   39                  The controller will reduce power to stay over this limit! usualy 2.85-3.05 V per cell of (39.0 (3.0 \* 13 = 39.0)). The standard Samsung cells allow down to 2.75V but you need some savety margine because not all cells are discharging in the same way, but by setting too high you loose range power on a discharged battery and capacity I like 29V for 10 Cells but 30V is saver

## 4: startup power boost {#startup_power_boost}

Here you can configure the BOOST feature. This feature gives a peak of
power to the motor at startup. The amount of time of the peak as also
the amount of motor power during the peak, can be configured. You can
also disable this feature if you prefer.

## 5: motor temperature protection {#motor_temperature_protection}

This feature is for protecting your motor from overheating and avoid
permanent damage/loss of torque \-- see here: **[TSDZ2 motor
demagnetized due to
overheating](TSDZ2_motor_demagnetized_due_to_overheating "wikilink")**.
You can only use and enable this feature [if you installed the motor
temperature sensor](How_to_install_motor_temperature_sensor "wikilink").

### How it works {#how_it_works}

On LCD3 temperature field you will be able to see the motor temperature
value. Once the configured minimum motor temperature value is hit, the
motor current will start to be reduced and as long as it increases, the
more the current will be reduce. After hitting the configured maximum
motor temperature value, the motor is shutoff.

The temperature value shown on LCD3 will blink when the motor current is
being limited and will blink faster for higher rates of limited current.
Finally, if the motor is shutoff, the blink rate will be very fast.

Possible configurations on LCD3:

  1                    enable current limiting           0 (disabled)         limit the motor current to avoid the motor get over the max temperature.
  2                    min temperature                   75 degrees Celsius   motor temperature value at which the motor current will start to be limited.
  3                    max temperature                   85 degrees Celsius   motor temperature max value at which the motor current will be zero / motor shutoff.
