Casainho bought a Decatlhon MTB bicycke with wheel size of 24'' for his son of 7 years old. The installation of TSZD2 is very straightforward.

Since the kid was light and not much experienced, the TSDZ2 OpenSource firmware was configure with a max low speed like 25km/h as also low motor motor max power as 200W and low motor current ramp of 4 amps / second. Also the kid could not do much force on the pedals as an adult so the assist levels factors were customized.

The battery pack was built on a local store and had relatively small capacity and the shape needed to stay inside of the triangle shape of the bicycle frame.
