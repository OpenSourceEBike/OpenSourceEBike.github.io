The TSDZ2 right pedal crank has a big distance to the bicycle frame
center ([Q-factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor_(bicycles)))
compared to the left pedal crank and this makes an awkward feeling of
sitting off centre even though you are being straight on the saddle. You
can improve this (reducing 65%) by installing a right pedal crank from
standard Bafang BSS mid drive motor, that you can buy online from many
shops like Ebay or Aliexpress.

Here an example of TSDZ2 installed with original pedal cranks - left

Here is the distance from the TSDZ2 original pedal cranks to my bicycle
frame:\
\* left side: 20mm

-   right side: 37mm

TSDZ2 original pedal cranks are a bit curvy but the right pedal crank
from standard Bafang BSS mid drive motor is less curvy and here are the
different distances to my bicycle frame:\
\
\* TSDZ2 original right pedal crank: 37mm

-   Bafang BSS right pedal crank: 26mm
