`<u>`{=html}The recommended display is the 860C because our firmware can
be installed without open it, has the best screen quality that improves
reading on outdoors as also keeps the original water/rain resistance.\
860C/850C and SW102 are very different displays, please see next tables
to help you decide what may be the best for you.
