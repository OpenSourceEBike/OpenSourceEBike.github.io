This ebike was built by installing TSDZ2 on a Decathlon full suspension
MTB model 540S. See more details about [How to install TSDZ2 on a full
suspension
bicycle](How_to_install_TSDZ2_on_a_full_suspension_bicycle "wikilink")
to understand the details about this Decathlon 540S model.

I use this ebike for commuting on the city as also to do MTB on
mountains. Sometimes I also do long travels in family.\
I have 3 bicycles of the same model. My bicycle have frame size L but
the other two have frame size M, for my wife and son of 9 years old.

As of 2020, I verified that the commercial electric MTBs has the same or
higher weight of ebike, with a battery with similar Wh. This means the
added weight on TSDZ2 to my original bicycle is small, which is very
good on MTB.

# Why I like so much this ebike {#why_i_like_so_much_this_ebike}

-   **Comfort:** the air full suspension that I adjust to my own weight,
    makes this ebike very comfortable
-   **Light:** TSDZ2 has the same or lower weight compared to similar
    comercial MTB ebikes
-   **Powerful:** TSDZ2 powerful, capable of output 500W continuous or
    bursts of 800W for some minutes
-   **Very efficient:** When I do MTB I always prefer to have a light
    and small battery and for that, TSDZ2 with our OpenSource firmware
    is great because it is very efficient and let me optimize the
    battery range by fine customizing the assist level factors as also
    the battery low voltage cut-off to take the max power of of the
    battery.
-   **Highly customizable:** I can easily swap custom batteries, I have
    ones optimized for MTB or long travels and others for commuting. For
    MTB I want light and smaller batteries, for long travels I also want
    light but also high capacity batteries and for city commuting I use
    more powerful and heavy batteries capably of pushing the TSDZ2 motor
    to limits.
    -   **Unlocked:** unlike comercial ebikes where the speed is limited
        to 25km/s and motor power to 250W, with TSDZ2 I can limit the
        speed and power to any specific value and without limits I can
        ride my ebike at 45 km/h on flat roads by pushing the motor to
        his limits of about 800W.

## City commuting {#city_commuting}

I go relatively easy to 45 km/h on flat roads in my city, but, with me
pedaling and giving about 150W myself and with the following conditions:

-   I weight 105 kgs
-   My ebike has 2.2 large tires and rear panniers, as shown on the
    following picture
-   No wind
-   I have a 52V battery and 48V TSDZ2 motor
-   I configure the battery max current to 18 amps and I have the motor
    temperature sensor installed
-   I have a chain ring of 50 teeth and 11T at rear, with 27.5 inches
    wheels

## MTB

-   I weight 105 kgs
-   I ride with the 2.2 large tires
-   Sometimes exchange my fixed seatpost by a dropper seatpost, this way
    I can go faster down the hill
-   I have different sizes/weight/Wh batteries and I choose my small
    350Wh battery for riding like 6 hours, 60 kms, 2000+ accumulated
-   I have a dual chainring installed and for MTB I use the 34T one. At
    rear I use a 40T and sometimes I use other cassette with 50T
-   Sometimes I do MTB with a lot of rain and mud

# TSDZ2 installation {#tsdz2_installation}

After removing the original bottom bracket, the TSDZ2 fits almost well
on this bicycle frame. For it to fit well, I had to use a file on the
TSDZ2 case as also a bit on the bicycle frame. In the end everything
worked well.

NOTE that I have 3 bicycles of the same model. My bicycle have frame
size L but the other two have frame size M, on this last ones I had to
file a bit more the TSDZ2 case.

On this picture is easy to see the pipe clamp and a metal bar I use to
fix the motor to the frame. This solution works very well:\

And because I have two chainrings, I had to improvise a way to fix the
shift cable and end cap:

Here the detail of the two chainrings:

Next pictures show a frame size M bicycle. This bicycle was built for my
son of 9 years old.

Detail of the original bottom bracket, chainring and pedals removed.
Although this bicycle has only one chainring, I installed the same two
chainrings of 34T and 50T as on the other bicycles:\
