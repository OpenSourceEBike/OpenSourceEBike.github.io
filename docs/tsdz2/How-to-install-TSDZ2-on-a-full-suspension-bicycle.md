The original TSDZ2 metal parts to fix to the bicycle frame probably will
not work on a full suspension bicycle and so we need to be creative and
probably build some metal parts that may be done in a DIY mode. This
page has some pictures and ideas from others users that may help you in
the process.

Please note that if you do not use such metal parts to fix the motor on
the place it is expected to be fixed on the motor case, it probably will
brake the motor case as reported by some users.

I bought on a local shop a pipe clamp and a metal bar and at home I had
to drill the metal bar and use file, etc. The metal bar I did to fix
TSDZ2 seems to be longer than needed, but it is to accommodate the front
derailleur not seems on the images. I also had to file TSDZ2 housing in
some parts to not touch the rear suspension triangle of the frame.

NOTE: although is not assembled/show on this picture, I do assembly
assembly the bottom bracket that comes with TSDZ2.\
