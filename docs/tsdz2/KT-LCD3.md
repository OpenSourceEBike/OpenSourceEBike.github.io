KT-LCD3 is a popular and cheap LCD made by Kunteng. You can buy it from many online shops that ship to worldwide - example:
* BMSBattery: https://bmsbattery.com/
* PSWPower/Elifebike: http://www.elifebike.com

NOTE: the KT-LCD3 24/36/48V also works well on 52V battery pack (14S).

There is a version that includes a USB charger but I never saw it - I guess is just the same as VLCD5 from TSDZ2 that uses internally a module board specific for charging USB and so don't has any difference to the LCD3 main board.
