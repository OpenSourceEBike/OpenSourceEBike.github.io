# TSDZ2 OpenSource firmware

This OpenSource firmware adds advanced features and customization that
are usually only available on expensive motors from big brands.  
The motor is driven more efficiently making it stronger and uses less
battery energy, as also it is very responsive and feels soft.  
  
**[Our OpenSource and DIY advanced
display](https://opensourceebike.github.io/)** makes the firmware more
user friendly, more customizable as also show more relevant information
to the user.

NOTE that previously we were using the 860C/850C color and SW102 but we
moved on to our own display.

This firmware development started on March 2018 by casainho and 6 months
after, [Jabalat an experienced user of TSDZ2 and ebikes, did a very
positive review on his Youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrWn6e8bIuQ). The development
is active and is being done for free by the community of users; some of
these developers work professionally developing this type of technology
for very well known companies.

# Why you should use this firmware

Feedback from users:

  - *the TSDZ2 now feels more like the Bosch motor*
  - *the motor is more efficient, stronger, it's feel like I have a new
    motor*
  - *the bike feels very responsive and is very fast and agile whenever
    you need it to*
  - *the info which is shown on LCD makes the total package way better*
  - *this is GOLD. I still have a smile on my face*

# Install TSDZ2 on your bicycle

The TSDZ2 can be quickly and easily installed on different bicycle
types, we have some notes and pictures for your reference, see this

# Buy TSDZ2 motor, display and battery

If you prefer to buy a motor and display ready to use with our
OpenSource firmware installed, visit the shops [Electrify
Bike](https://www.electrifybike.com/tong-sheng-tsdz2.html#/) or [Eco
Cycles](https://www.eco-ebike.com/collections/tsdz2-open-source-firmware-osf-products)
- these shops made a fair amount of contributions to the project and
have very good technical knowledge and so they probably can provide a
good customer support.

There are many online shops selling TSDZ2 motor and the parts for
maintenance. You can find on popular ones like
[Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/) or
[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/) but you may want to pay attention to the
costs of shipping and custom taxes - for example in Portugal (may be
similar in other EU countries), the shipping and handling at customs
costs for DHL courier (usually very fast shipping like 5 days) can be a
minimum value of 90€ for a part that costs only 15€. For the same part
of 15€, you may choose shipping by regular post (usually slow shippinng
like 30 days) and you will probably not pay anything for the handling at
customs and not even custom taxes.

There are shops that have local stock, and even if the prices are higher
than buying directly from China on like Aliexpress, the final price can
be lower because you will not have to pay extra costs for handling at
customs and custom taxes. [PSWPower](http://www.pswpower.com/) is a
popular shop and usually have local stock on EU, US and Russia of TSDZ2
motor and batteries.
