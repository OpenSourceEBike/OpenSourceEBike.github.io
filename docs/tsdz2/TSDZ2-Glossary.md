| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ADC` | Analog Digital Conversion - getting an analog value into the controller like the throttle-value |
| `FOC` | Field Oriented Control - a new way of driving the motor which is more efficient |
| `EEPROM` | 'Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory ' non-volatile memory (state persists between power cycles) - settings are saved here |
| `ERPS` |Electronic Revolutions Per Second - This is the number of pulses per second you get as the motor passes the permanent magnets around the commutator in the motor. There are 16 magnets - 8 pairs, giving you a pulse every 45 degree turn of the motor shaft. To convert ERPS to RPM you divide by 8 then multiply by 60.  |
| `PWM` | Pulse Width Modulation - a digital signal that is created through a modulation technique, which involves encoding a message into a pulsing signal.  PWM Duty Cycle refers to the proportion of 'on time' to a regular interval. (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation)) |
| `SOC` | State Of Charge - the percentage readout of home much battery is remaining, you can access it by pressing the middle and bottom buttons together |
| `PAS` | |
| `SVM` | Space Vector Modulation |
