# Firmware forks {#firmware_forks}

Here developers can introduce their forks and their main motivation!

[Casainho:](https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2_wiki)
Casainho, the founder of the flexible OpenSource firmware for TSDZ2,
developed the firmware to be used with modern and more capable displays
(yet the popular and cheap ones) that makes this firmware more user
friendly as also capable to have advanced features and customization
that are usually only available on expensive motors from big brands.
This displays can be bought ready to use or in alternative the users can
install the firmware by themselves.

[Mbrusa:](https://github.com/emmebrusa/TSDZ2-Smart-EBike-1) Using the
TSDZ2 open firmware v0.20 (buba version) with the original Tongsheng
displays (VLCD5, VLCD6 and XH18). No need to buy, solder and flash extra
displays. Comfortable graphical user interface for use with
Windows-laptop as well as [OS/X or Linux
laptops](https://github.com/emmebrusa/TSDZ2-Smart-EBike-1/wiki/OS-X-and-Linux-installation).
Main discussions on this Marcoq-Mbrusa software fork and
Stancecoke/Mbrusa Java configurator at [Tsdz2 firmware open source
adapted to vlcd5, vlcd6 and
xh18](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=98281).
