# The Difference Between Standard and Advanced Mode

The cadence sensor can be used in two modes of operation: Standard and Advanced.

The standard mode of operation operates in the same way as any other cadence sensor. The system measures the low-to-high transitions and the time between those transitions. The time between two transitions is used to calculate the cadence.

The Advanced Mode measures the time between all transitions and has therefore a faster response time with the added benefit that it can also increase the operating range. It makes the system respond quicker and improves the experience in many ways for all riding modes. Highly recommended for all users. Especially if using the TSDZ2 coaster brake version. Note that the advanced mode only works after a proper calibration.

# How to Activate the Automatic Calibration and Advanced Mode:

Step 1: Put a zip tie around the pedal as shown in the picture below. [Casainho add picture from Buba]

Step 2: Go to the Configuration Menu by holding the UP and DOWN buttons.

Step 3: Go to the Advanced Menu.

Step 4: Go to the Cadence sensor mode and select Advanced Mode.

Step 5: Lift the back wheel from the ground as the motor will engage when you hold the DOWN button. A tip is to tilt the bike on its stand so it is supported by the front wheel and the rear stand. Another solution it to temporarily remove the chain from the TSDZ2 chain ring.

Step 6: Hold the DOWN button until the number shown in the odometer field stabilizes or just fluctuates by a small amount.

Step 7: When the number shown in the odometer field stabilizes or fluctuates slightly the system has calibrated. Simply let go of the DOWN button and the value will be saved.

Step 8: Remove the zip tie.

Step 9: Have a nice ride!
