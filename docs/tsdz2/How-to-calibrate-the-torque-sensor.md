# Why it is important to calibrate the torque sensor? {#why_it_is_important_to_calibrate_the_torque_sensor}

Almost every torque sensors on TSDZ2 is different and reports different
values for the same weight on the pedals. Some have low sensitivity /
very short linear zone only up to 15 kgs while others up to 45 kgs, as
also different sensitivity on left and right pedals. As comparison,
riders like me can do peaks of 40 or 60 kgs on pedals without lift the
butt from the saddle.\
\
Why this is important? because if you want the best motor response and
natural feeling of a bicycle, the torque sensor needs to work/be linear
the best possible. Also, this is the only way to trust on the
measurements shown on display for the pedal human power.

Here is TSDZ2 1 and TSDZ2 2 the torque sensors measurements - the torque
sensor of TSDZ2 2 is way better!!, here the comparison:

Notes:

1.  One torque sensor is kind of linear only up to 15 kgs while other up
    to 45 kgs. The rate/sensitivity are the same for both on this
    \"linear\" zone but clearly mine lacks resolution because this zone
    is very short. I can do peaks of 40 or 60 kgs on my pedals without
    taking my butt from the saddle.
2.  One torque sensor seems to measure the similar values for both left
    and right pedals while the other does not (the left pedal has lower
    sensitivity).
3.  The one that is worst on 1. is also worst on 2. So, clearly there
    are torque sensors that are worst than the others.

Explanation of torque sensor calibration done by an user on the forum:\
\
*The basic idea is that the values the torque sensor reports (raw
values) are different for almost every TSDZ2 out there. To normalize the
values curve, you need to measure the value on the torque sensor for
various known weights. This way the firmware can build a curve and map
torque sensor values to actual weight on the pedals.*

*So you need to have a set of known weights (or use a luggage scale as
some have done) and put these weights on the pedals while pressing the
brakes so the bike doesn't move and with crank arms parallel to the
ground.*

*You then write down the torque sensor value and the weight that was on
it. For both left and right (they have different values).*

*Once done, enter them in the google docs to have the curve so you can
see if you didn't make a mistake (curve should not have drastic spikes
or you probably made an error in measuring), and you can also use it to
interpolate missing weights if you don't have a good range of available
weights.*

*You then enter all this in the display configurations menu. The weight
reported in the firmware after calibration should match the weight in kg
of whatever is on the pedal with crank arm parallel to the ground at
that moment. In my experience it's not ultra accurate but should be
within a kilo or two of the actual weight in kg.*

# How to calibrate your torque sensor {#how_to_calibrate_your_torque_sensor}

-   go to Technical configuration menu to see torque sensor ADC value in
    real time
-   use weights, your own known weight, weight from other members of
    your family or friends (mainly others with different value), put
    them on each pedal only (the pedal crank arms must be parallel to
    the ground)
-   take note of each weight value and ADC value (for your own weight
    measurement, you can lean the bike against a wall, hold the brakes
    and stand on pedal)
-   choose 8 points, first one with 0 weight value and last one with
    your weight
-   [a copy of this calc sheet as seen on the next
    image](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OwM1yURzHkPsrL9uz8oNlX6FHGzw_nr2TolGgUH9oy4/edit?usp=sharing%7Cmake).
    Edit the weight and ADC values on the table and the graph will
    update automatically, choose the other 6 points near the knee zone
    as seen on the graph and not on flat zones. You can extrapolate some
    points if you donÂ´t have the weights, follow the curve on the graph
    but try to validate with real measurements:

-   go to Torque sensor configuration menu and input the data of each
    point: weight and ADC value

# How to adjust the torque sensor {#how_to_adjust_the_torque_sensor}

**Warning**: this is optional and **is not advised to do** since is a
very delicate process and risky because it involves disassembling part
of the TSDZ2 motor and handle the torque sensor. The coils and the wires
of the torque sensor are fragile and you must handle them with care (you
can always buy a spare torque sensor on online shops like PSWPower).

Steps needed:

-   disassembly the torque sensor (follow the [TSDZ2 Repair Manual.pdf
    file from
    here](https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2_wiki))
    -   you don\'t need to remove the motor controller or the motor
    -   you will need to remove the main gear, then the axle and finally
        the torque sensor
    -   the coils and the wires of the torque sensor are fragile \--
        make sure to handle them with care and make sure to **disconnect
        the torque sensor wires from the motor controller otherwise
        there is a high probability that the wires will break near the
        torque sensor coil when you remove it!!**
    -   make sure to not loose the 3 small springs that are under the
        torque sensor coil
-   with the torque sensor outside, make sure to hold both coils against
    each other and aligned (maybe using some adhesive tape). Take care
    to not use to much force as the coils are fragile.
-   connect the torque sensor wire to the motor controller but make sure
    the TSDZ2 motor is disabled with the brakes are pressed and motor
    assist at 0
-   turn on TSDZ2 on LCD and go to configuration menu, advanced data,
    and look at torque sensor ADC value
-   you will need to adjust the position of the sensor (that black part)
    and so you will need to loosen the two small screws, as seen on the
    following picture
-   move slightly the sensor (from right to left and keep it far from
    the little magnets) part until you read an ADC value of 100 up to
    120 (note that a value under 100 means that probably the sensor is
    not detecting the little magnets, then you need to move it to lefMy
    wife TSDZ2t side)
-   now tighten the screws but you will see that probably the ADC value
    will change as the position of the sensor will change - you need to
    tighten the screws slowly while keep adjusting the sensor position
-   when the screws are finally tighten, you can test the sensor by
    doing some light force on the top part, like seen on the picture
    bellow, where I was using a screw driver (but place it on the right
    side and apply light force that will make that metal parts flex very
    little to left side). You should see the ADC values increasing and
    always go the value you calibrated before in the interval of 100 to
    120
-   assemble the torque sensor
    -   when assembling the torque sensor, don\'t forget to install the
        3 small springs under the coil, just like they were when you
        disassembled.
    -   maybe you can put your motor on horizontal so the springs are in
        place when you use the hammer to force the torque sensor to go
        to his place. Please do it in very small steps and make sure the
        coil, springs, wires, etc are in place. It is easy to damage the
        coil if it is out of the place.
-   after assembly again the torque sensor on the TSDZ2, finally apply
    force with your feet on the pedals and verify that ADC torque sensor
    values are the same you expect - please refer to the values on table
    top.

# Add on: How to repair a torque sensor {#add_on_how_to_repair_a_torque_sensor}

-   If your Torque Sensor is not working, it could be due to a faulty
    Hall Sensor. Here is how I replaced it:
-   Peel off the black stuff to investigate (in my case the Hall Sensor
    pins / solder pads were torn off.)
    -   Be extra careful to not harm any of the tiny SMD parts
        underneath.
-   The Hall Sensor is a std \"49E / OH49E / SS49E\" Hall sensor as
    found on ebay.
-   Just solder it back on - for details, see linked picture below:
