There are two different ways to flash the firmware on 850C display and
only one on 860C display:

1.  860C/850C: [Flash using
    bootloader](Flash_the_firmware_on_860C_850C_using_bootloader "wikilink")
    (recommended as will avoid the need to open the display and this way
    will keep the manufacturer water ingress protection).
2.  850C: [Flash using
    SWD](Flash_the_firmware_on_850C_using_SWD "wikilink") (recommended
    only for developers as SWD will let debug the firmware).
