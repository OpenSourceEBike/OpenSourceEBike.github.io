This is the EBike board schematic, that is very easy to build due to easy to solder boards and connectors:

The main component is the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 N8R2 board that you can buy in Aliexpress. This is the microcontroller board, that runs the Pyhton software and has Wifi and Bluetooth capabilities.

The only other board is the TJA1050 that is a CANBUS module. This board is needed to make the ESP32-S3 board being able to communicate with the Bafang M500 torque sensor.
