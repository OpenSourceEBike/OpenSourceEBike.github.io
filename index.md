# TSDZ2 Wireless Project 
## Background
The project objective is to provide wireless to the TSDZ2 mid drive motor, free and OpenSource, making it support GPS bike computers, a mobile app and a wireless remote. The goal is to emulate and improve upon commercially available wirelessly controlled ebikes like the  [Specialized Turbo Levo Ebike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F43oqj1Zlww).

The project utilizes the proven and popular **[TSDZ2 Flexible Open Source firmware](https://github.com/OpenSourceEBike/TSDZ2_wiki/wiki)** (original developed to be used with the SW102 or 850C/860C displays running our OpenSource firmware).

## EBike wireless controller

We have developed a **[DIY EBike wireless controller](ebike_wireless_controller.md)** to connect to the motor controller, on the display connector. With it alone, you can power on/off the TSDZ2 motor, increase/decrease assist levels and see the Ebike battery level.<br>
This wireless controller implements Bluetooth and ANT, is easy to build and costs only 25€ in materials.

## Mobile app

We also developed a **[mobile app](android_app_operation.md)** and with that you can control the TSDZ2 motor as also change his configurations - there are over 100 configuration options that can be customized to fit any user's particular requirements!

## Fully wireless and wired remotes

We have also developed a **[DIY fully wireless remote](remote/build_remotes)**. There is also more simple wired remote if you prefer.<br>
With this remotes, is possible to power on/off the TSDZ2 motor, increase/decrease assist levels, display Ebike battery level and more.<br>

The wireless remote can also connect to a GPS display like a Garmin Edge to change data pages. It costs only 20€ in materials and uses a coin battery that will work for more than 2 years.
